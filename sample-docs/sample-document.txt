Knowledge Base Search Engine - Technical Overview

This is a sample document for testing the RAG-powered Knowledge Base Search Engine.

Project Overview:
The Knowledge Base Search Engine is a sophisticated document retrieval and question-answering system built with Next.js, AI SDK, and ChromaDB. It implements Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to provide accurate, context-aware answers based on uploaded documents.

Key Features:
1. Document Upload: Users can upload PDF, TXT, and DOCX files
2. Semantic Search: Uses OpenAI embeddings for semantic similarity matching
3. AI Synthesis: GPT models synthesize answers from retrieved documents
4. Source Citations: Automatically cites source documents in responses
5. Dark/Light Mode: Full theme support with system preference detection
6. Real-time Streaming: Responses stream in real-time using AI SDK

Technical Architecture:
- Frontend: Next.js 15 with React 19 and Tailwind CSS
- AI Integration: Vercel AI SDK with OpenAI models
- Vector Database: ChromaDB for embedding storage and retrieval
- Document Processing: Custom pipeline for text extraction and chunking
- Theme System: next-themes for seamless dark/light mode switching

How RAG Works:
1. Documents are uploaded and processed
2. Text is extracted and split into chunks
3. Each chunk is converted to embeddings using OpenAI
4. Embeddings are stored in ChromaDB vector database
5. When a user asks a question, it's converted to an embedding
6. Similar document chunks are retrieved using cosine similarity
7. Retrieved chunks are provided as context to the LLM
8. The LLM synthesizes an answer based on the context
9. Sources are cited in the response

Supported Models:
- GPT-4o: Most capable model for complex reasoning
- GPT-4o Mini: Faster and more cost-effective
- GPT-3.5 Turbo: Budget-friendly option for simple queries

Use Cases:
- Internal knowledge base search for companies
- Research paper analysis and question answering
- Documentation search and synthesis
- Legal document review and analysis
- Educational content exploration

Performance Considerations:
- Chunk size affects retrieval accuracy (default: 1000 chars)
- Overlap ensures context continuity (default: 200 chars)
- Top-K parameter controls number of retrieved chunks (default: 5)
- Embedding model choice impacts speed and accuracy

Future Enhancements:
- Multi-modal support (images, tables)
- Advanced filtering and metadata search
- Conversation memory and follow-up questions
- Batch document processing
- Analytics and usage tracking
